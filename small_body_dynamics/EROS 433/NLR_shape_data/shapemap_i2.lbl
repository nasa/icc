  the original NLR shape map file submitted ('NLR125AR.IMG') to be            
  compatible with the FITS formatting standard. The scale and offset

  rounded to the nearest integer. This the resolution of this file            
  is one meter, versus the 0.25m resolution of the original data. A           
  version of this data is also supplied in 4-byte floating-point              
  format in the file 'SHAPEMAP_R4.FIT'. NLR coverage is mapped in

    This data product is a shape map of Eros at a resolution of               
    0.125 by 0.125 degrees, based on altimetry data acquired by               
    the NLR instrument. The NLR profile data are the source for               
    this data set. The map is in the form of a binary table with              
    one row for each 0.125-degree latitude, from 0 to 360 degrees             
    East longitude and 90 to -90 degrees latitude. The binned                 
    data include edited NLR observations from 200-km orbits and               
    lower, using the NLR393 orbit solutions produced at NASA-GSFC.            
    A total of approximately 15,889,635 observations are represented,         
    ranging in radius from 3020 to 17666 meters.
