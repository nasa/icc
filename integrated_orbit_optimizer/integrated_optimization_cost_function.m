% Cost function for GBO.
% Inputs
% - Swarm, a structure describing the current state of the system
% - Initial conditions for all orbits relay orbits (to be specified by
%    optimizer, possibly in a scaled form)
% - Location scaling factor (a horrible hack)
% - Gravity model
% - Bandwidth parameters, a struct with three fields: 
%  - reference_bandwidth, the bandwidth at a given reference_distance
%  - reference_distance
%  - max_bandwidth, a maximum bandwidth for close-by ops
% Outputs:
% - Goal, the amount of science delivered
% - Gradient, the gradient of the amt of science delivered wrt the the
%    relevant variables

% taking the mean data rate, excluding zeros. We use the mean, as opposed
% to the median, because we do _not_ want to throw out outlier instruments
% generating a disproportionate amount of data.
