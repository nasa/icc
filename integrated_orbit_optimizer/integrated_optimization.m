function [swarm] = integrated_optimization(swarm, gravity_model, bandwidth_parameters, max_optimization_time)
% Optimizes all orbits by using a gradient-based trust region algorithm (fmincon).
% For a given set of orbits, observations and relays are optimized by
% calling observation_and_communication_optimizer
% Syntax: [swarm] = integrated_optimization(swarm, gravity_model, bandwidth_parameters. max_optimization_time)
% Inputs:
%  - swarm, a SpacecraftSwarm object
%  - gravity_model, a GravityField object as used by SpacecraftSwarm
%  - bandwidth_parameters, a struct with three parameters:
%    - reference_bandwidth, the bandwidth at a given reference distance
%    - reference_distance, the reference distanc3e
%    - max_bandwidth, the maximum available bandwidth at close range
%     The model assumes a quadratic bandwidth model
%  - max_optimization_time, the maximum time allocated to fmincon.
% Output:
%  - swarm, a SpacecraftSwarm object with updated orbits.
