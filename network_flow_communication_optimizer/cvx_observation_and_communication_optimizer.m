function [swarm, goal] = cvx_observation_and_communication_optimizer(asteroid_model, swarm, bandwidth_model, data_scaling_factor)

% How to best collect observations and route data from a number of science
% spacecraft to a carrier s/c, given an observation model and a network
% bandwidth model.
% Solves the problem as a single-commodity flow, leveraging CVX.
% A _much_ faster version that uses CPLEX or MOSEK directly is available as
% observation_and_communication_optimizer.m, with the same syntax.
% Syntax:
%  [swarm, goal] = observation_and_communication_optimizer(asteroid_model, swarm, bandwidth_model, data_scaling_factor)
% Inputs:
% * asteroid_model is the asteroid model created by SphericalHarmonicsGravityIntegrator_SBDT
% * swarm is the object defined in SpacecraftSwarm.m
% * bandwidth_model is a function. bandwidth_model takes in a pair of
% locations x1, x2 and returns a bandwidth (in bits) between the
% spacecraft. If the bandwidth is not specified, a quadratic model
% providing 250 kbps at 100 km is used.
% * data_scaling_factor is a factor by which the data flows are scaled
% internally. Useful to ensure the problem is well-conditioned.
% Outputs:
% swarm, the updated Swarm object
% goal, the optimal goal

if nargin<4
    data_scaling_factor = 1;
end
if nargin<3
    bandwidth_model = @(x1,x2) quadratic_comm_model(x1,x2);

% The problem is TUM, so observations are supposed to be 0-1. But sometimes
% we have numerical inaccuracies. This is a ugly hack to get around that.

%% Get observability and reward
% First, let's find out what points are observable
% observable_points is a N by K cell matrix. observable_points(i,k) is the
% list of points that spacecraft i can observe at time k

        end
    end
end

% Create observable points map, same data as observable_points but in more
% convenient format.
% observable_points_map is a list of N cells. Each cell contains a Nv x K
% sparse matrix with value 1 iff the vertex v can be observed by sc i at
% time k.

% Next, let's define the coverage reward map, i.e. the reward for a point
% (if it can be observed)
% Reward_map is a list of N cells. Each cell contains a Nv x K matrix
% listing the reward for observing vertex v at time t.
reward_map = get_coverage_reward_map(asteroid_model, swarm);

% Finally, we define the reward including observability.

% reward_with_observability_map = cell(1,N);
% for i = 1:N
%     reward_with_observability_map{i} = sparse(observable_points_map{i}.*reward_map{i});

%% TODO for a faster V2
% build the matrix by hand
% Use smarter indexing: only consider vertices with nonzero reward
% Also only use comm links with nonzero bandwidth.
% You may want to make liberal use of find()
% For instance, find(reward_with_observability_matrix) returns a set of
% column vectors for the indices and values of
% reward_with_observability_matrix. Then iterating through the column
% vectors gives a natural index for the feasible observations.
% What you can do is: find(), then define a linear index 1:1:length(...),
% then build a new sparse matrix where the matrix values correspond to the
% index element. Like
% [rvec, nvec, tvec, content] = find(reward_with_observability_matrix)
% obs_index_linear = 1:1:length(rvec)
% obs_index = sparse(rvec, nvec, tvec, obs_index_linear)
% Plot twist! MATLAB does not support sparse 3D matrices. That is why Mark
% was using cells.
% The dumb thing is to fill in the matrix that says "observation(r,i,t) is
% index d" manually with a for loop. This is painful but may actually not
% be _that_ terrible.
