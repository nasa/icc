function [swarm, goal] = communication_optimizer(swarm, bandwidth_model, data_scaling_factor)

% How to best get data from a number of science spacecraft to a carrier
% s/c, given a network bandwidth model. Solves the problem as a
% single-commodity flow, leveraging CVX.
% Syntax:
%  [flows, effective_science, delivered_science, bandwidths, dual_bandwidth, dual_memory] = communication_optimizer(swarm, bandwidth_model,data_scaling_factor)
% Inputs:
% * swarm is the object defined in swarm.m
% * bandwidth_model is a function. bandwidth_model takes in a pair of
% locations x1, x2 and returns a bandwidth (in bits) between the
% spacecraft. If the bandwidth is not specified, a quadratic model
% providing 250 kbps at 100 km is used.
% * data_scaling_factor is a factor by which the data flows are scaled
% internally. Useful to ensure the problem is well-conditioned.
% Outputs:
% * flows, a matrix of size K by N by N.
%   flows(k,i,j) contains the data flow from s/c i to s/c j at time k.
% * effective_science
% * delivered_science
% * bandwidths
