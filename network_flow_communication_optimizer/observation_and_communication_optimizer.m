function [swarm, goal] = observation_and_communication_optimizer(asteroid_model, swarm, bandwidth_model, data_scaling_factor)

% How to best collect observations and route data from a number of science
% spacecraft to a carrier s/c, given an observation model and a network
% bandwidth model.
% Solves the problem as a single-commodity flow, leveraging CPLEX or MOSEK.
% Syntax:
%  [swarm, goal] = observation_and_communication_optimizer(asteroid_model, swarm, bandwidth_model, data_scaling_factor)
% Inputs:
% * asteroid_model is the asteroid model created by SphericalHarmonicsGravityIntegrator_SBDT
% * swarm is the object defined in SpacecraftSwarm.m
% * bandwidth_model is a function. bandwidth_model takes in a pair of
% locations x1, x2 and returns a bandwidth (in bits) between the
% spacecraft. If the bandwidth is not specified, a quadratic model
% providing 250 kbps at 100 km is used.
% * data_scaling_factor is a factor by which the data flows are scaled
% internally. Useful to ensure the problem is well-conditioned.
% Outputs:
% swarm, the updated Swarm object
% goal, the optimal goal

% code, keep in mind that:
% All variables are flattened in a linear index. Observation decision
% variables come first, followed by flows and delivered science. 
% For observations, we have a mapping from decision variable to (time,
% spacecraft, vertex) encoded in the vectors p_k, p_v, and p_s.
% Conversely, for flows and delivered_science, we provide a mapping from
% (time, spacecraft, spacecraft) (resp. (time)) to the index of the
% decision variable through flows_finder() and delivered_science_finder().
% When indexing observations, we liberally use find() on the vectors p_* .
% When indexing flows and delivered science, we loop through the indices
% and call the *_finder functions.

% First we define the index for the observation variables.
