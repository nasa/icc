%SC_COMMUNICATION_SINGLE_HOP Simulates single-hop relay of data to the

%
%   Inputs:
%    - sc_previous_pos [m]: [N_SPACECRAFT x 3] Array of sc positions at
%   	previous iteration
%    - sc_current_pos [m]: [N_SPACECRAFT x 3] Array of sc positions at
%    	current iteration
%    - carrier_current_pos [m]: [N_SPACECRAFT x 3] Array of carrier
%    	position at current iteration
%    - asteroid_radius [m]: Equatorial radius of asteroid
%    - standard_comm_data_rate [bits/s]: Data flow rate between spacecraft
%    	and carrier
%    - sc_memory_use [bits]: Vector containing the current memory usage of
%    	each spacecraft
%    - sc_max_memory [bits]: Scalar indicating the maximum memory capacity
%       of the spacecraft
%    - delta_t [s]: Discrete timestep used for the update
%
%   Outputs:

%    - sc_memory_use [bits]: Updated memory usage vector
