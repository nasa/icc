%DIFFERENTIABLE_NORM_OF_DIFFERENCE Returns functions to compute the norm of
% the difference between two vectors, and its derivative.
%   v1 is a 3x1 vector.
%   v2 is a 3xNv vector.
%   The function returns three values:
%   Normdiff(v1,v2) is simply norm(v1-v2,2);
%   dnormdiff_dv1(v1,v2) is a vector of the same length as
%   v1, containing d(norm(v1-v2))/d(v1)
%   dnormdiff_dv2(v1,v2) is a vector of the same length as
%   v1, containing d(norm(v1-v2))/d(v2)

assert(all(size(v1)==[3,1]), "ERROR: v1 should be a column vector of length 3");
assert(size(v2,1)==3), "ERROR: v2 should be a matrix with three rows and one column per vector of interest");


% TODO vectorize (this should be norm(v1(i,:)-v2(j,:));
%normdiff = sqrt(v1'*v2); % This is a row vector of the same length as
%size(v2,2). normdiff(i) is the norm of v1-v2(:,i)
