function [a,da_dv1, da_dv2] = differentiable_angle_between_vectors()
%DIFFERENTIABLE_ANGLE_BETWEEN_VECTORS Returns a function computing the
%angle between two vectors, and its derivative with respect to the
%components of both vectors.
%  The function returns
%  - a(v1,v2) = arccos(1/(norm(v1)*norm(v2) *dot(v1,v2))
%  - da_dv1(v1,v2), the derivative of a wrt v1
%  - da_dv2(v1,v2), the derivative of a wrt v2
%
