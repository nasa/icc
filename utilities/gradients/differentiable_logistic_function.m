function [sf, dsf] = differentiable_logistic_function(edge, width)
%DIFFERENTIABLE_LOGISTIC_FUNCTION returns a logistic function and its derivative
%   The function takes three inputs:
%   - edge, the location of the sigmoid transition
%   - width, the width of the transition
%   The return value is a function.
%   The function returned takes in a 1d input and returns
%   (1/(1+exp(-(x-edge)/width)))

sf = @(x) (1./(1+exp(-(x-edge)./width)));
dsf = @(x) sf(x).*(1-sf(x))./width;

end
