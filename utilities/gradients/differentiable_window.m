function [wf,dwf] = differentiable_window(lower_edge,upper_edge, lower_width, upper_width)
%DIFFERENTIABLE_WINDOW returns a "window" function and its derivative
%   The function returns a one-dimensional "window" function, the product
%   of two sigmoids. It takes four inputs:
%   - lower_edge, the lower edge of the window
%   - upper_edge, the upper edge of the window
%   - lower_width, the "width" of the lower edge. By default, 1.
%   - upper_width, the "width" of the upper edge. By default, equal to
%      lower_width
%   The return value is a function.
%   The function returned takes in a 1d input and returns
%   (1/(1+exp(-(x-lower_edge)/lower_width)))*(1-(1/(1+exp(-(x-upper_edge)/upper_width))))

if nargin<3
    lower_width = 1.;
end
if nargin<4
    upper_width = lower_width;
end
