%GET_VORONOI_DATA computes information for a discrete Voronoi tesselation
%from a given set of sources using wavefront propagation. 
%Note: the current implemenation does not account for the Euclidian
%distance between nodes. 
%   [voronoi_cells, voronoi_boundaries, voronoi_nodes] = get_voronoi_data(sources, neighbor_set, *max_steps)
%   *optional input
%   
%   Inputs: 
%    - sources [N_SOURCES x 1]: The indicies for a set of source nodes on the small body 
%    - neighbor_set [N_VERTICES x 1]: A cell containing the neighbors (i.e.
%    connected verticies) for each vertex. 
%       e.g. neighbor_set{i} will contain all verticies sharing a face with
%       vertex i 
% 
%   Outputs: 
%    - voronoi_cells [N_SOURCES x 1]: A cell containing the nodes in the
%    coverage region for each Voronoi tesselation
%       e.g. voronoi_cells{i} is a vector containing the indicies of all of 
%       the points in the ith partition of the tesselation 
%    - voronoi_boundaries [N_SOURCES x 1]: A cell containing the nodes
%    composing the boundary of each of the repective partitions 
%       e.g. voronoi_boundaries{i} is a vector containing the indicies of
%       all of the nodes in the ith partition that have neighbors in a 
%       different cell
%    - voronoi_nodes [N_SOURCES x 1]: A cell containing the points in each 
%    partition have neighboring nodes in at least two other cells
