function neighbor_set = create_neighbor_set(V,E)
%CREATE_NEIGHBOR_SET processes shape model data into a cell of connected
%nodes. Nodes are said to be connected if they share a face. 
%   Syntax: neighbor_set = create_neighbor_set(ShapeModel)
%   
%   Inputs: 
%    - ShapeModel: A struct with fields
%       - Verices [N_VERTICES x 3]: Vertex points of the body (in 3-space) 
%       - Faces [N_FACES x 3]: Faces defining body
% 
%   Outputs: 
%    - neighbor_set [N_VERTICES x 1]: A cell containing the neighbors (i.e.
%    connected verticies) for each vertex. 
%       e.g. neighbor_set{i} will contain all verticies sharing a face with
%       vertex i
