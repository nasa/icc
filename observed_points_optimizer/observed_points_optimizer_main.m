function Swarm = observed_points_optimizer_main(AsteroidModel, Swarm, sc_optimized, sc_find_observable_pts)
%OBSERVED_POINTS_OPTIMIZER  Determines which points the spacecraft will
%observe given their orbits.
%   Note: The third and fourth input arguments are optional. They provide
%   the capability for iterative use of the optmizer.
%
%   Syntax: Swarm = observed_points_optimizer_main(AsteroidModel, Swarm, sc_optimized, sc_find_observable_pts)
%    *optional input
%
%   Inputs:
%    - AsteroidModel
%    - Swarm
%    - *sc_optimized: (optional) specifies the subset of agents whose
%        observation points will be optimized.
%        e.g. if sc_optimized = [1,3] then observation parameters will only
%        be calculated for agents 1 and 3
%    - *sc_find_observable_points: (optional) specifies the subset of
%        agents in sc_optmized for which the "observable_points_map" will
%        be computed. This should only be applied to agents whose observed
%        points have already been calculated though a previous call to this
%        function.
%
%   Outputs:
%    - Swarm
%
% WARNING: current logic only supports case where spacecraft only carry a
%  single instrument
