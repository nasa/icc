%MONTE_CARLO_COVERAGE_OPTIMIZER  Generates a set of random orbits, and
%assigns one of these orbits to each instrument carrying spacecraft in the
%swarm. (does not set carrier orbit)
%   The orbits are chosen sequentially (one spacecraft after another) 
%   such that the overall coverage reward is maximized on each iteration.
