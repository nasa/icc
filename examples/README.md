# Examples

Demonstrations of module capabilities and usage examples.

- `ICC_Simulation.m` demonstrates the usage of various utility functions in
 the context of creating a complete icc simulation. Heuristics are used to 
 determine design parameters such as communication flow and initial state 
 of the spacecraft.

- `Plot_Orbits.m` provides a usage example of the small body dynamics 
integrators.

- `Communication_Optimization_Demo.m` provides a usage example of the network
flow communications optimization module.

- `Monte_Carlo_Coverage_Optimization_Demo` Demonstrates the usage of the
monte_carlo_coverage_optimizer module by finding the best orbits from a 
Monte Carlo. Results are simulated using the visualization utilities. 

- `Observed_Points_Optimizer_Demo` Demonstrates usage of the
_observed_points_optimizer_ module by finding the observation points
accociated with randomly generated orbits. 

- `Voronoi_On_Eros` provides a usage example of the functions in the 
coverage optmization module that are used to create Voronoi partitions on 
a small body.
