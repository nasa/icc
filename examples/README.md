# Examples

Demonstrations of module capabilities and usage examples.

- `ICC_Simulation.m` demonstrates the usage of various utility functions in
 the context of creating a complete icc simulation. Heuristics are used to 
 determine design parameters such as communication flow and initial state 
 of the spacecraft.

- `Plot_Orbits.m` provides a usage example of the small body dynamics 
integrators.

- `Communication_Optimization_Demo.m` provides a usage example of the network
flow communications optimization module.
